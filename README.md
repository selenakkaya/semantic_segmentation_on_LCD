# Semantic Segmentation on Landslide Containment Devices 
### Master Thesis of Politecnico di Torino

This thesis analyzes the application of semantic segmentation models with different approaches and aims to do a model selection and find the best optimal model with a grid search. The research focuses applying semantic segmentation on main component of landslide containment devices that are mesh and wire. 

In this thesis, binary and multi-class semantic segmentation models are explored and, U-Net and U-Net++ architectures are compared. Additionally, a grid search
is conducted to find the best suitable parameters for the employed models, different combination of hyper-parameters are evaluated. The research provides insights into the use of semantic segmentation for landslide containment devices, and highlights the importance of appropriate data pre-processing and model selection for achieving accurate and reliable results. 
Model performance is evaluated on test sets and eported as well as the prediction images are demonstrated with the original image and ground truth image for better visualize the performance of the model.
